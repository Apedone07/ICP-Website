        <h1>Innovation Pathway Program</h1>
        <main>
        <h2>Description Of Our Program</h2>
          <p>The Innovation Career Pathways was made to help students in Worcester Public Schools explore different careers through technical education. In the program, students pick a career they like, get recognized credentials, plan for college and careers, take college-level classes for career growth, and boost their experience with an internship or project.</p>
        
          <p>Worcester Public Schools teamed up with many organizations and businesses to create a program that fits students' needs and the work market. We're proud to work with:
            <ul>
                <li>MassHire Central Region Workforce Board</li>
