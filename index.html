        <h1>Innovation Pathway Program</h1> 
        <main>
        <h2>Description Of Our Program</h2> 
          <p>The Innovation Career Pathways was made to help students in Worcester Public Schools explore different careers through technical education. In the program, students pick a career they like, get recognized credentials, plan for college and careers, take college-level classes for career growth, and boost their experience with an internship or project.</p>
